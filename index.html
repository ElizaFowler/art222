<h1> Eliza's Website <h/1>
<p>Hello, my name is Eliza Fowler. Welcome to my website!!</p>
<p>Project One</p>
<p>For this project I created a logo for the Southworth planetarium. I was inspired by space and the USM husky logo, and wanted to combine the two. 
  I wanted this logo to look like a husky playing with Saturn as if it were a ball.</p>
